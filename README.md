## Project Overview:
Our project aims to develop a first-person shooter (FPS) game inspired by the classic game Doom. This game will blend retro aesthetics with modern graphics techniques to create an engaging and visually appealing experience. The game will feature a series of levels, each with unique enemies, challenges, and graphics themes.
Motivation:
To learn advanced graphics programming techniques by creating a fun small scale video game. This should cover a variety of techniques, including 3D rendering and pipeline, interactive user input, combat against AI enemies, textures and animations, data structures and the algorithms involved, and level design and creation. This seems like something enjoyable and educational, as well as fulfilling.

## Objectives:
Graphics Rendering:
Implement advanced rendering techniques to achieve high-quality visual effects.
Incorporate lighting, shadows, and textures to enhance the game environment.
Gameplay Mechanics:
Develop smooth and responsive control mechanisms for player movement and actions.
Design enemy AI and combat dynamics.
Level Design:
Create diverse and immersive levels with unique architectural designs.
Integrate interactive elements and environmental hazards.
Audio and Visual Effects:
Implement immersive sound effects and background music.
Use particle effects and shaders for realistic visual impact.
Performance Optimization:
Ensure the game runs efficiently with optimized code and graphics assets.
Conduct testing for various hardware configurations.

## Technologies and Tools:
Game Engine: [Unity]
Programming Language: C#
Graphics APIs: OpenGL/DirectX/Unity
Audio Libraries: [Need to Research]
Development Tools: [To Be filled in]
